The global operational Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (Global RTOFS) at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction is based on an eddy resolving 1/12Â° global configuration of HYCOM (HYbrid Coordinates Ocean Model)/CICE4 (Los Alamos Sea Ice Model), and a muti-variate 3DVar data assimilation system,  RTOFS-DA. Global RTOFS is part of a larger national backbone capability of ocean modeling at the National Weather Service and was developed in strong partnership with the US Navy.

<br>
<b>Additional Information:</b>
<br><br>
The Global RTOFS ocean model runs once a day and produces a nowcast and 8 days of forecasts. Daily initializations include daily analyses with RTOFS-DA, a multi-variate, multi-scale 3DVar ocean-ice system with quality control and variational analysis. Observations assimilated include 1) satellite and in-situ Sea Surface Temperature, from METOP, JPSS-VIIRS, ships, and buoys; 2) satellite Sea Surface Salinity from SMAP, SMOS; 3) profiles of temperature and salinity from XBT, CTD, Argo floats, buoys, gliders, Alamo floats, and animal-borne sensors; 4) Absolute Dynamic Topography from Jason, Cryosat, Altika, and Sentinel; 5) sea ice concentration from SSMI, and AMSR. Other observing systems will be included in the near future. 
 

<br><br>The current operational version of the RTOFS is version <?php
echo $version; ?> as of <?php echo $implementation_date; ?>. The
service change notice can be found <a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/notification/pdf2/scn22-71_rtofs_v2.3.pdf"
target="_blank">here</a>. Verification for the operational GFS and other operational global models can be found by navigating the links to the left.
<br><br>Verification is done using the <a href="https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/EVS" target="_blank">EMC Verification System (EVS)</a>, which uses <a href="https://github.com/dtcenter/METplus" target="_blank">METplus</a>.
